# /mn/ Allow only access from Croatian IPs for most users! (because of automated password stealing attacks and website malware installs!)
# 
# Note: if there is entry for specific user, do not forget to end it with "- : username : ALL" or make it only "+ : username : ALL" !
# Note: if there is entry for specific user, only his line are processed -- "? : ALL : xxxx" do not apply! ("- : ALL : ALL" at the end of the file also does not apply then!)
# Note: netmask for IPv4 mapped IPv6 adresses like  "::ffff:*" is not the same as IPv4 netmask!! (CIDR /24 in IPv4 is /112 in IPv6 instead -- you must add +96 for "::ffff:" format!)
# Note: logs in /var/log/auth.log in format ("vsftpd: pam_access(vsftpd:auth): access denied for user `video1' from `::ffff:95.170.95.60'") -- if you do not see "pam_access" identifier, it is not realated to this file (but probably invalid username or wrong password or shell)
